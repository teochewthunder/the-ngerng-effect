# The Infinite Scroll a.k.a The Ngerng Effect

I named this little script after the infamous blogger Roy Ngerng, who also happens to be a tremendous windbag. Many of his blogposts seem unnecessarily repetitive, thus I came up with this idea to simulate a never-ending scroll of his staements on a HTML page.

This requires a little bit of JavaScript trickery. We write functions to generate satements which *look* like they could have been written by Roy Ngerng, then generate enough to fill an entire screen, and more. When th user scrolls to the bottom, the script activates and populates the body with *more* lines. 

Thus, Infinite Scroll.
